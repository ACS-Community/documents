%but its open source property enabled other projects to be using it as well.%
Now that the development phase of ACS for ALMA is in its final stage, there is the intent of generating a more active community around it, to promote continuous 
development of the framework.
To achieve this task an initial guidelines proposal for a community branch of ACS is presented.
